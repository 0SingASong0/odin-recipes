            <li>220g caster sugar</li>

            <li>1 tsp vanila extract</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
            <li>small pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
        <b>For the ganache</b>
        <ul>
            <li>300ml double cream</li>
            <li>300g dark chocolate</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. 
                Grease and line 2 x 20cm (8in) cake tins and 
                set aside. In a large bowl, beat together the butter 
                and sugar until pale. Add all the remaining sponge 
                ingredients and beat together until well combined. 
                Divide the mixture between the cake tins and 
                smooth the tops. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes 
                or until an inserted skewer comes out clean. 
                Once baked, cool in the tins for 10 minutes, 
                then remove from the tins and transfer to a cooling 
                rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the ganache. Heat the double cream 
                gently in a saucepan and break up the dark chocolate 
                into cubes and place in a bowl. When the cream is 
                just under the boil, pour it over the dark chocolate,
                 ensuring it’s all covered, and allow to stand 
                 for 2-3 minutes. Whisk the ganache gently 
                 until it starts to combine and goes glossy. 
                 Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then place in the 
                 fridge for around 30 minutes, 
                 until it is a spreadable consistency.</li>
            <li>Once the sponges are cool, lay one with the topside 
                down on a cake stand and spread 
                with 1/3 of the ganache mixture. 
                Top with the other sponge, topside up and push down 
                slightly to secure it onto the filling. 
                Ice the top of the cake with the remaining mixture 
                by piling it in the centre and spreading it 
                to the sides of the top sponge. 
                Bring it down the sides gradually and smooth 
                with a palette knife. Serve in large slices.</li>
