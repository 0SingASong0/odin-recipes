        <ul>
            <li>25g butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>750g onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tsp plain flour</li>
            <li>100ml dry white wine (optional)</li>
            <li>2 beef stock cubes (or vegetable stock cubes)</li>
            <li>1-2 sprigs fresh cut thyme, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>8 thin slices baguette, or similar crusty bread</li>
            <li>125g Gruy√®re cheese, grated</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter and oil together in a large 
                heavy-based pan over a medium heat. 
                Add the onions and salt and cook for 10 mins, 
                stirring regularly until softened. 
                Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid. 
                Cook for 15 mins, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook, uncovered, 
                for another 10-12 mins or until the onions 
                are very soft and caramelised. 
                Keep stirring every so often to stop them catching.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in the flour and stir to mix well. 
                Increase the heat and pour in the wine, if using, 
                allowing it to bubble away for a few mins. 
                Make up the stock cubes with 1 ltr hot water and 
                add to the pan along with the thyme sprigs. 
                Bring to the boil, then leave to simmer for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill to high. Toast the baguette slices 
                on each side. Ladle the soup into 4 heat-proof bowls 
                or dishes and top each with 2 baguette slices. 
                Scatter with the grated cheese then cook under 
                the hot grill for 1-2 mins until the cheese is melted, 
                bubbling and golden.</li>
            <li>Garnish with freshly ground black pepper 
                and a few fresh thyme leaves to serve.</li>
        </ol>
